# 谓语

[toc]

## 1 谓语是什么

- 谓语这个词对我们绝大多数读过点书的人来说可能是再熟悉不过的了。但是，如果真让你说出“谓语是什么”的话，估计大多数人会一时语塞。即使最终说出解释，也可能不那么准确。那么，究竟谓语是什么？谓语一般由动词或动词短词充当，用于表示一个句子(或者从句)中主语的行为动作或状态。 谓语是句子主干(主谓宾)三个核心成分之一。 这个解释可以更清楚地写为以下三点。

- 谓语的位置通常是在主语的后边。

- 谓语用于表示主语的动作、行为或状态。

- 谓语是构成句子主干的核心成分之一(而非修饰或补充等的句子成分)。一条句子中，无论在意思上还是在结构上，谓语往往是最关键的成分。阅读时抓住谓语往往是看清一条句子的关键。无论是英语还是汉语，可以说谓语都具有以上的共同特点。而就英语而言，其谓语在语法上则有以下几个主要特点：

- 谓语有一套清楚的表达格式，包括时态，被动语态，虚拟语气等，用于表达动词发生的时间，动作是否为被动，以及说话人的语态。这一套表达格式是谓语独有的，所以也成了我们阅读时可用于区分谓语动词和非谓语动词的一个很好的参考。这也意味着，英语学习者熟练掌握谓语的时态、语态、语气必不可少。

  - 例：They **are doing** some exercise. 他们**正在**做练习。(现在进行时态)
  - 例：He **was killed** by a single bullet in his heart. 他**被**一颗子弹射中心脏而死。 (过去时被动语态)
  - 例：If he **had read** any of those books, he **would have known** the answer. 他**若是**看了这些书中的任何一本，**就**知道答案了。(虚拟语气)

- 谓语动词前可以有情态动词，非谓语动词则没有。 记住这个特点也有助于我们看清句子。阅读的过程中，如果遇到情态动词，那么可以肯定随后出现的动词就是谓语了！我们在写作时也要注意这一点。比如，在表达“能”的意思时，谓语动词可以直接在前面加“can”,来表达，而不定式

  (非谓语动词)要表达这个意思就只能用另一种方式(“be able to”)来表达。如下面的例子：

  - We **can finish** this job on time if everyone does his bit. 每一个人都尽自己的本分,我们就能按时完成这项工作。

  - I was very pleased **to be able to help**. 我能够帮上忙感到很高兴。

- 一条主句或一条从句只能有一个谓语(并列谓语的情况除外)，所以在阅读时，如果能确定谓语的位置，则句子的主心骨（主干）就基本抓住了。同样道理，除了谓语之外，句子中如果出现其他动词，则都必顺采用非谓语动词的形式。这一点，学生在写作文时要牢牢记住。

## 2 谓语动词单复数形式

- 在英文句子中，谓语的写法应该与主语的数保持一致。当主语在意义上为复数时，谓语动词必须采用相应的复数形式。当主语在意义上为单数时， 谓语动词须采用相应的单数形式。

  - 谓语动词的复数形式一般使用动词的原形来表示。 另外，be(助)动词复数形式在一般现在时和现在进行时中写为are, 在过去时态写为were。
    - These books **belong** to me. 这些书是我的。

    - They **are** absolute beginners. 他们完全是生手。

    - The workers **are** pushing for higher wages. 这些工人在争取增加工资。

    - The streets **were** filled with people. 街上到处都是人。

    - These roses **have** beautiful blooms.这些玫瑰花开得真美。

    - These facilities **have** benefited the whole town. 这些设施使全城受益。
  - 谓语动词的单数形式的写法规则如下: 
    - 通常在动词词尾加s, 如: work -- works    create -- creates

    - 动词如果以ch, sh, s, x 或 o 结尾时，需加es, 如: teach -- teaches   fix -- fixes

    - 动词以辅音加 y 结尾时, 先变 y 为 i, 再加 es, 如: cry -- cries  reply -- replies

    - be(助)动词单数形式在一般现在时和现在进行时中写为 is, 在过去时态写为 was。

    - (助)动词have 的单数形式写为 has。

    - 当主语为 I 时, be 动词单数形式写为 am (过去时用was)。
      - She **works** hard from morning to night. 她从早到晚辛勤工作。

      - He **teaches** modern Chinese literature in the university. 他在大学教现代中国文学。

      - When the curtain **rises**, Juliet is writing at her desk. 幕启时，朱丽叶在办公桌旁写东西。

      - He **is** a genius. 他是个天才。

      - The water **is** boiling. 水正开着呢。

      - He **was** only three years old when his mother died. 他母亲去逝时他才三岁。

      - The river **was** threatening to overflow its banks. 河水大有决堤之势。

      - The notice **was** put above the door. 布告贴在门的上方。

      - She **has** three kids. 她有三个小孩。

      - He **has** cheated me. 他骗了我。

      - I **am** afraid of him. 我很怕他。

      - Hearing that news, I **was** really sad. 听到那个消息后，我真的很伤心。
  - 当谓语动词前有助动词时，则单复数形式应体现在助动词上。
    - Some boys **don't** like to bath regularly. 有些男孩不喜欢经常洗澡。

    - She **doesn't** eat much breakfast. 她早点吃得不多。

    - Peter **has** been there before. 彼得以前去过那里。

    - They **have** been there before. 他们以前去过那里。

    - He **is** working on the report. 他正在做报告。
